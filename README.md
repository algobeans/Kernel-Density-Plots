Renderings of a 3D histogram and kernel density plot of all shots made by Liverpool in the 2017-18 English Premier League. The bottom two images are equivalent â€“ the left image depicts a 3D hills-like rendering of the kernel density plot, whereas the right image depicts a 2D contour-like image of the same kernel density plot.
